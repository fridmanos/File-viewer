# File-viewer
A simple program to navigate directories and output files.
<hr>
Some gotchas:

Note that the function get_current_dir_name() used in the program is a GNU extension and may not work on all compilers.
Also note that setting the -e switch to a file editor requires the file editor to have the ability to open a file in the following syntax. editor-name <file>

This was compiled using g++ version 6.3.0 on the authors machine.
